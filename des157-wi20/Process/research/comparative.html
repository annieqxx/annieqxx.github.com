            <h2>Site 1</h2>
            <p>
                For the first site, I want to discuss the grandfolk website. This is a site that developed mainly for elder people. Since for my final product I introduced on my abstract, I wanted to do some healthcare communication website that is includesive for older generation people. Thus, I wanted to make my UI for my final product as simple as possible. I am showing below an interface of the gradfolk.

            <p>In addition to that, I wanted to involve different health care feature on my site. For instance, I have to have different sections, which some for health care news, for health care information, for online talking with doctors and so on. Gradfolk did a great jobs to involve different sections at the home page, as the shown below.</p>

            <h2>Site 2</h2>
            <p>For the second site, I chose the NASA site for kids as my research site. Since for my project, I wanted to not only to include elder people, but also young kids. Thus, I wanted to combine elements for kids and for elder people to create a site that could be benefit for both these two groups. Images below shows a screen shot of the NASA site</p>
            <img src="images/NASA_Web.png" alt="NASA for kids" title="nasa.gov/kidsclub screen capture" width="600" height="auto">
            <p>I will want to do some thing like the nasa for kids did, which is to include a lot of illustrations, and I wanted to make those illustrations interactive.</p>
