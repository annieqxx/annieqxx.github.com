            <!-- Consume at least three sources of information on your subject -->
            <!-- Your research should be exploratory and academic Helps you think deeply -->
            <p>Article by Ollie on Smashing.com said in his article, "Designning for Older People", that "This seems unfortunate when you consider all of the things technology has to offer older people." From his research, right now in the market, most of the technology products are designed for younger adults or teens in order to profit. However, he said, older people do exit. We must consider special techniques for involving older people to the age of technology. In his research, he listed the different products that is existing in the market for the older people right now, it is mainly depend on two techiniques, first the listening or the audio system, and second the larger text or the vision system. However, the UI for those products are pretty bad, and it is very user-unfriendly, which means it is really hard to use. As you could see from the phone that was designed for older people. </p> <p>I read couple article regarding the topic of designing for older people, I think there are couple essential point that I must notice for my deisgn. First, the similicity and user-friendly interface of the website. For older people, they may not use to the technology as the younger people do. However, we want them be digital inclusive, and we want to them could get useful information on the website. According to my research. I think older people are the same with younger kids. Although these two group have a huge age gap between them, they active the same on the technology. Both of the group does not adapted to techonology usage mainly because they are not expose to the internet as much as the teens or the younger adults are. Thus, we want to make the interactive, and the user-interface understandable for them. In the meanwhile, we also wanted to use the simple UI and the interactive to convey certain information to them. </p>
            <p>In addition to the first point, since older people do not use techonology often to get information, they are easily trapped by rumors. In my abstract for my final product, I talked about the Coronavirus that happened in China. A lot of the older people in China, they do not have their mask on immediately when the virus broke out mainly because they do not get the up-to-date information from the internet, and they only listen to oral spreads. Thus, it is important to get some website that is suitable for older people to use, and they can get updated and useful health information from checking the website. Thus, for the design, I wanted to make something not only easy to use for the older adults, but also intereted enough for them to be attracted to use it daily to get information. </p>
